aund 1.07
 * Added REMUSER command, removes user from the password file but
   does not remove the user directory or files.
 * Added NEWUSER command, creates user in password file and creates
   home directory.
 * File Server can now be any station number configured in the 
   /etc/aund.conf file.
 * Openin, Openout and Openup now validate and support access permissions.
 * The load command now honors the permission flags as well.
 * Creating a directory did not check if the user had the correct
   permission for the directory they were currently in, this has
   been fixed.
 * The access command now works and changes permission on files in the
   file server as expected. Supported are LWR/WR, sorry no E for the 
   moment. 
 * Added user permissions check when writing a file. If the file does
   not have the correct permissions then you cannot write the file if
   it already exists.  If its a new file we check if you are the owner
   of the directory.
 * Deleting a file will now check for the Locked attribute and error
   if this is set.  You can remove this using the access command.
 * Delete will also check if you have the correct write permissions
   for either the owner or public, depending on what access we decide
   you have.

aund 1.06 * 
 * Change to user permissions on directories
   If the users current path, matches the user root directory at
   the start at least, we assume that this is owned by the user
   otherwise you have public access.
 * If you have privilege then you will always be the directory owner

aund 1.00

  This first standalone release of aund is distantly derived from the
  version distributed as part of NetBSD "othersrc".  It has been
  heavily hacked to add support for read/write operation, BeebEm
  virtual Econet, and older clients.  It lacks many useful features
  and is full of bugs (especially memory leaks), but has nonetheless
  proved to be of real utility.
