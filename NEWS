aund 1.06.5
 * The load command now honors the permission flags as well.
 * Creating a directory did not check if the user had the correct
   permission for the directory they were currently in, this has
   been fixed.

aund 1.06.4
 * The access command now works and changes permission on files in the
   file server as expected. Supported are LWR/WR, sorry no E for the 
   moment. 
   - Outstanding: Getting load to honor the permissions like save does, 
     and check that get and put byte(s) does the same.

aund 1.06.3
 * Added user permissions check when writing a file. If the file does
   not have the correct permissions then you cannot write the file if
   it already exists.  If its a new file we check if you are the owner
   of the directory.
 * Deleting a file will now check for the Locked attribute and error
   if this is set.  You can remove this using the access command (not 
   implemented yet).
 * Delete will also check if you have the correct write permissions
   for either the owner or public, depending on what access we decide
   you have.

aund 1.06 * 
 * Change to user permissions on directories
   If the users current path, matches the user root directory at
   the start at least, we assume that this is owned by the user
   otherwise you have public average
 * If you have privilege then you will always be the directory owner

    clients, with an option to remove this restriction.

    of Econet file servers.

aund 1.00

  This first standalone release of aund is distantly derived from the
  version distributed as part of NetBSD "othersrc".  It has been
  heavily hacked to add support for read/write operation, BeebEm
  virtual Econet, and older clients.  It lacks many useful features
  and is full of bugs (especially memory leaks), but has nonetheless
  proved to be of real utility.
